# F4Playground
Flutter Playground - Widgets made used for other apps

- bip24 tool
- providers handling globals for wallet funcs
- custom theming w/ providers
- node selectin tool with providers
- gorouter for proper nesting routing
- ...

Currently this is building out many modular parts of what will be a wallet app (both mobile and desktop)

@NOTES
 - will load in bips on create then go through another page explaining to then fire at the recover page (mabe fdynamic title via constructor for illusion of diff page). This will onboard into the app.
