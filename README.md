# F4Playground
Flutter Playground - Widgets made used for other apps

bip tool not updated to the version my "x4Wallet" is using. Local bips, no middleman.
#### will update this tool later to match x4Wallet or just open source the wallet and the bip tool itself. 
!! (in x4 I use different a different technique on some parts) 

- bip24 tool
- providers handling globals for wallet funcs
- custom theming w/ providers
- node selectin tool with providers
- gorouter for proper nesting routing
- ...

Currently this is building out many modular parts of what will be a wallet app (both mobile and desktop)

@NOTES
 - will load in bips on create then go through another page explaining to then fire at the recover page (mabe fdynamic title via constructor for illusion of diff page). This will onboard into the app.
